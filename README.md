# Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time sign language detection system using machine learning techniques. The system processes live video input and identifies hand gestures to interpret sign language. The primary goal is to enable communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing by translating sign language into text or spoken language.

## Features
- Real-time video input processing.
- Detection and classification of hand gestures.
- Translation of detected gestures into text or spoken language.
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

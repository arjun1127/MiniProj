Why are we using this specific neural network that is media pipe + LSTM layers
 => we can see in many of the research paper that many have used a number of CNN layers + LSTM layers or some have
    use pre-trained mobile nets to train along with LSTM layers
    => using this in their models was less accurate for real time sequence that we were going to collect
    => so the main reason for using LSTM layers + Media pipe

    => Fewer Data required to produce a hyperactive model
    => Much denser Neural network rather than having millions for parameter in our neural network we have few
    => So this NN is much faster

 we have used categorical_cross-entropy loss function because we have multi class classification model so
 =>in case we are using regression with neural network we would be using mean-square root loss function
    if binary class classification then we would use binary cross-entropy
